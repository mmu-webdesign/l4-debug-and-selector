        <!-- we have an em tag that transforms into an <i> tag. I would probably use an <i> tag here as we are just indicating this is the name of the band -->

        <p><i>Disaster Area</i> is the name of the band in the series of <i>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i> Science Fiction books written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams">Douglas Adams</a>.</p>

        <!-- the original html had the text 'Douglas Adams' outside the link - links should have an opening <a> tag, then the hyperlink text, then the closing </a> tag, as above. -->

        <p>Within the books they are generally regarded as not only the loudest rock band in the Galaxy, but also as being the loudest noise of any kind at all.</p>

        <!-- this <h2> tag wasn't closed correctly. -->
        <h2>Current band members</h2>
        <p>Their members include:</p>
        <!-- this is an unordered list rather than a paragraph. -->
        <ul>
            <li>Hotblack Desiato (lead singer)</li>
            <li>A drummer</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- remove the final </p> tag as <ul> and <p> are both block level elements - it doesn't make sense to wrap a paragraph around a list. -->
        <!-- main should be all in lower case -->

    <footer>
        <!-- we had a src attribute rather than a href attribute, and the closing tag was around the wrong way - <\a> is not correct. -->
